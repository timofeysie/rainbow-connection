# Rainbow Connection

This is a Raspberry Pi multi-project repo.

It began 8 years ago (November 5th, 2016 5:32 AM) to hold code for Raspberry Pi 3B demos.
It then held a xAPI in Angular 2 learning game which remains incomplete.

Currently it has a few Raspberry Pi Pico projects, such as Emoji Badge variations along with Emoji OS and a Raspberry Pi Zero timelapse project.

The most recent work is going into a Pico game medallion which can bring all the above projects together as one system to be used with the proposed learning sport.

This will require an external React webapp to let users register for a game with their medallion and act as the referee during the game.

See the docs directory for details about these projects.
