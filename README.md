# Raspberry Pi Node API

Using [this tutorial](http://www.robert-drummond.com/2013/05/08/how-to-build-a-restful-web-api-on-a-raspberry-pi-in-javascript-2/) 
as the starting point for a client server app for Raspberry Pi interaction.

The app depends on NodeJS, and other Node libraries.
The first time you run this app, you will need to install the libs.
In the project directory, run the following command in a terminal:
```
$ npm install
```

Run the application using the following command again from the project directory:
```
$ node server.js
```

You can then point your browser at http://localhost:3000/
